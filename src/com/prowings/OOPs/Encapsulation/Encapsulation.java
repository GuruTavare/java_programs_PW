	 * Where,
	 * data= variables or fields.
	 * code=functions or methods.
	 * The main purpose of encapsulation is hiding the data(i.e. if developer wants to hide some data 
	 * from client or second party he can use encapsulation eg.teacher only wants to show the marks 
	 * of student not how the marks were calculated he/she can use here getter-setter methods).
	 * the real time example of encapsulation is POJO(Plain Old Java Object) class.
	 * POJO class is nothing but have private data(variables/fields) and to get this data getter-setter methods 
	 * also present in same class.
